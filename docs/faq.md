# Smart contracts and security

### What is a smart contract and how does it protect my transaction?

A smart contract is a verifiable and immutable executable script on the blockchain. Once deployed, it cannot be altered. Audited and secure, smart contracts handle transactions and store funds safely. They ensure that parties receive lease agreements upon payment, with the landlord guaranteed payment.

### What security methods are implemented on the platform?

Our audited smart contracts protect against Reentrancy and Flash Loan attacks. Lease information is encrypted and stored on private servers, and data is hashed when interacting with the blockchain.

### Can I change the terms of a smart contract after it is created?

No, smart contracts on the blockchain are immutable. However, before signing, both parties can agree to modify the terms and create a new contract.

### How is my data stored and privacy ensured?

Sensitive information is encrypted and stored on our secure servers. On the blockchain, information is hashed (one-way encryption), ensuring that it cannot be decrypted. This protects your data from being exposed. NFTs are stored in custodial wallets, shielding them from possible attacks.

### How long is deal information stored on the blockchain?

All transaction information on the blockchain is stored indefinitely, ensuring transparency and immutability. At the same time, personal data remains encrypted and inaccessible to third parties. However, the ability to decrypt will be disabled once the contract expires and all contractual obligations are met and parties have not agreed to prolong the contract.

### Why do I need to pass KYC?

KYC (Know Your Customer) verifies user identities for auto-generating rental contracts and ensuring legitimacy. Your data is confidential and won't be shared with third parties.

### What happens if my wallet is hacked?

In the event of an attack on your wallet or key theft, your NFTs and data remain protected thanks to our custodial storage system. We offer two-factor authentication and other security features.

### How can living costs be reduced with our platform?

The use of smart contracts and blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries and reduces commissions. Automating rental processes also lowers transaction costs and speeds up the processing of deals. In addition, the flexible rental terms guaranteed by our platform allow people to reduce rental costs in the long term. And of course, transparency, as blockchain-based Smart Contracts automatically record all rental and payment terms, eliminating hidden fees and unexpected costs.

# Tenant and Landlord

### How can I be sure the landlord is reliable?

One of our core values is the verification of users and properties. This allows users to be sure that the intentions of the other party are bona fide. All actions are stored in blockchain which shows and confirms actions, a security deposit protects both sides, contract creates contractual obligations. In addition to this, we have verification of all properties and tenants, all objects are real, their location is real and no duplicates can be found on our platform.

### What benefits will I receive as a tenant?

Tenants get access to transparent, secure, and protected rental terms, automated payments, and 24/7 support. This makes the rental process efficient, simple, and secure. Also, with advanced search, market analytics, and historical data for each property, tenants can find the right property as quickly as possible.

### What benefits will I receive as a landlord?

Landlords gain access to marketing tools, a personal dashboard for managing properties, market analytics, and secure payments. Additionally, Rentdar offers free listings, smart contract creation, and no hidden fees, ensuring landlords receive the full requested amount and save their time.

### Does Rentdar have a tenant/landlord assessment option?

Yes, Rentdar allows both tenants and landlords to review each other, fostering transparency and accountability.

### If the tenant pays in cryptocurrency, can I withdraw AED to my bank account?

Yes. Landlord before posting any apartment can choose options to withdraw money, while tenant can pay using any available option, without affecting landlords.

# Dispute Resolution

### What should I do if I have a problem with my rent?

The first thing to do is to discuss the problem between the parties. If you can't resolve the problem with the landlord or tenant, Rentdar offers a built-in dispute resolution system. You can file a complaint through the platform, providing details and evidence of your problem.

### What to do if one of the parties fails to fulfill its obligations?

In case of default by one of the parties, the deposit held on the smart contract is transferred to the affected party in the form of compensation for penalties. In cases requiring assistance for dispute resolution, the dispute can be settled with the involvement of our company's support service and governmental authorities.

### Can I transfer the rights to another person?

The basic contract does not stipulate the transfer of rights to another person, but in case of agreement between the tenant and landlord, you can transfer the tenancy rights to another person through Rentdar, but this depends on the terms of the lease and consent of parties.

### Can a landlord re-let a property when I live there?

No, landlords cannot re-let the same unit without your consent, just as tenants cannot sublet without the landlord’s approval unless otherwise specified in the lease. All terms and conditions are set out in the contract, which is fully legally valid.

# Rental process

### What steps do I need to take to rent a property?

First, create an account and complete verification. Then, browse available properties on the marketplace and book the one that suits your needs. You can meet with the landlord online or in person. Payment through Rentdar signifies agreement to the terms and conditions, which is equivalent to signing a contract. Full instructions are available [here](https://rentdar-docs.vercel.app/docs/tutorial-basics/user-perspective).

### Can the terms of the contract be negotiated directly?

Yes, terms can be negotiated before renting. Once agreed upon, the landlord can update the price and list it as a private listing for you to book. (Only basic terms can be modified; other contract aspects are standardized.)

### How does canceling a reservation/terminating a contractual relationship early work?

Each contract has provisions about early termination of the contract, and fines for such violations may differ depending on the agreement between landlord and tenant. Contract termination request should be approved by both parties on the Rentdar site. After approval takes place, the contract will be moved from the current rents to the finished folder. Termination contract confirmation will appear in the user cabinet on the platform. In the event of a conflict, both parties can contact mediators to help resolve the dispute.

### How can I renew a lease on an existing agreement or sign a new one?

If the property in question is available for rent prolongation, the process is similar to the initial one with the initial initiation and creation of a new smart contract. The platform will send a notice to renew the lease 3 weeks prior to the end of the current contract to notify both the Landlord and Tenant. If prolongation is approved, the deposit will be automatically transferred to the next period. Transfer of the deposit protects the rights of both Tenant and Landlord.

### Are short-term rentals available?

Yes, it is possible. Depending on the conditions specified by landlord, the lease term may vary. One of Rentdar`s activities is partnership with the segment of hotels and hostels and short-term apartment leases, making the short-term rental option available.

### Can I get a printable original contract?

Currently, you can request a PDF version of the contract. In the future, this process will be automated.

### Can I view the property before renting?

The platform provides high-quality verified photos of the property (in addition 360-degree views of properties will be added). You can arrange to meet the landlord for an in-person viewing. However only renting through Rentdar after viewing can ensure security, privacy, transparency, and ease of renting.

### Can I rent a property without a preview?

Yes. One of our core values is to verify users, properties, and object listings. This allows the user to be sure of the quality of the information provided about the property even without a preview. Rent can be digitalized!

### How does a Smart-safe deposit work?

Smart-safe deposit is only available to Rentdar users and works using smart contracts and blockchain technology to make the process as transparent and secure as possible. Here's how it works:
‍

- Making a deposit: when the tenant and landlord agree on a lease, the tenant makes a deposit on the platform. This amount is locked into a smart contract.
  ‍
- Deposit storage: the deposit is stored on the blockchain where it is protected from fraud. The smart contract automatically records all conditions related to the deposit (e.g., when and under what conditions it must be returned).
  ‍
- Fulfillment of conditions and return of deposit: At the end of the tenancy, it checks whether the conditions of the contract have been fulfilled (the contract has ended and there has been no damage to the property) and awaits confirmation from both parties. If the conditions have been met, the deposit is automatically returned to the tenant. If a breach has been found part of the deposit may be passed on to the landlord. All amounts are specified in the contract. If only the tenant has confirmed the deposit withdrawal, the landlord has two weeks to appeal, if no complaints are received from the landlord within two weeks, the deposit is returned to the tenant in full.
  ‍
- Dispute resolution: In case of disputes (e.g. if the landlord claims damages), the landlord requests the tenant to retain part of the deposit (amounts are specified in the contract) if both parties agree, the deposit is distributed between the parties. In case of a dispute, the platform can propose settlement mechanisms that verify the fulfillment of the terms of the contract.

### Is it possible to pay a security deposit/ rent accommodation with cryptocurrency payment?

Yes, this option is possible. The refundable deposit and rental payment can be paid in cryptocurrency (USDT, USDC, in cases where the landlord is ready to accept ETH it also can be accepted). In crypto payments, the amount is the amount converted at the exchange rate at the time of the transaction.

### Can I track my rental payments in the app?

Yes, with Rentdar Marketplace, you can easily track your rental payments. Our app provides payment reminders, a payment calendar, and a comprehensive history of your transactions. You’ll also have access to an overview and detailed breakdown of your spending for a clear understanding of your rental expenses.

### Can I track my payments for an off-plan property buyout?
